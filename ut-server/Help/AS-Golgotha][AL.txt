Comments	  (GRZ)	: Original Golgotha][ final is extremly buggy and has a few flaws.
			  This AL version has all spawn issues with objectives completed
			  in alternative routes problems solved.
			  
			  Also I added 2 new teleporters for defense. 1 teleporter at start
			  defense spawn to take you to Main Castle, mainly so you can have
			  an overview of possible launches.

		          Second teleporter is in the second defense spawn that takes you to
			  the Castle wall.

		     	  Changed a few textures in mid and end section inside the towers.

		     	  People had problems running the map on their servers, this was mainly
			  due to golgo.u file, which now is imported into the map itself and is
			  no longer needed (thx to Weirdo).

		     	  Some minor weapon reposition at end and other various glitches.
			  
			  Enjoy

			  Grz

Comments	(Weirdo): The blockall actor count has been reduced from 2177 to just over 870
			  and all the hole-filling has been optimised to avoid "sticky" walls.
			  
			  A few tweaks have been made around the map, including the end-scene,
			  which is now sync'd perfectly.

			  As mentioned, the meshes have now been imported directly to the map
			  eliminating the need for the serverpackage, so the texture download
			  is now only triggered when the map is in-play.
