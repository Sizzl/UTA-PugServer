AS-Rook-[PUG]
Pickup Game edition of the oldskool Paint the Door map.
In order to make the map more fair and competitive i've changed a few things.
Overal layout has not been touched but did add an alternative route to the end objective.

-----------------------

Changelog 31th October 2020 ( To Equalize the map ending. Defenders had an advantage here... )

- Final door now opens with a touch-trigger. The door itself still takes about 20 sec.
- Redone the alternative route to come up ABOVE defenders spawn instead of aside.
- Defender Spawn Cut-off button now also temporarily disables Canyon Spawn. Therefore defenders only come out of storage for about 20 sec.
- Added additional route that opens up a Single hammer launch from out of the main cave.
- Replaced Shieldbelt in attackers spawn with thigh-pads.
- Replaced Courtyard belt with Armor.
- Replaced Defenders Armor with Thigh-pads.

Changelog 22th October 2020

- Adjusted BlockPlayer Actors to have higher height radius.
- Made small adjustments to endgame canyon. Now has an small house were a teleporter triggers the endgame.
- Adjusted defenders spawn point back in map. Takes a little longer (2 sec or so) to get into the final area to give attackers a better chance.

Changelog 6th August 2020

ATTACKERS SPECIFIC CHANGES
- Added shieldbelt in spawnarea. Hammerjump needed to obtain.
- Added signs nearby teleporters for quick reference.
- Added ammo to Minigun and Shockrifle.

DEFENDERS SPECIFIC CHANGES
- Defenders now spawn in a room with teleporters. ( Courtyard - Library - Canyon )
- Minigun in spawnroom.
- Removed biorifle on defender side, replaced by ripper.
- Thighpad replaced with Armor
- Flakcannon added.

OVERAL GAMEPLAY CHANGES
- Added Shieldbelt near Gatehouse. Hammerjump / boost needed.
- Added BlockPlayer actors on castle walls to avoid 10 second map completion.
- Added alternative route to end objective. 
- Added defensive tower near end objective.

NOTE
Hammerboost via gatehouse over the main doors is still possible. But players will need to drop between the two doors and take the alternative route. Obviously there is a specialevent trigger when such thing occures to inform defending team.
