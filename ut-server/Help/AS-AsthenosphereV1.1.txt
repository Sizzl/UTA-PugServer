Description             :In 2250, the liandri mining corporation funded the construction of 
			a middle-earth research vessel whose purpose was to study the 
			convection currents of magma below the earth's surface and their
			effect on mineral deposits and land formation.

			Soon after its introduction, the craft was deemed useless and it 
			was abandoned.

			Now that the tournament has taken hold of the company, it was 
			decided that this research vessel would make a suitable arena for 
			assault play.

			The attackers, who have hidden themselves within a shipment of 
			cargo, must infiltrate the vessel, disable the reactor cooling 
			fans, and exit the base in one of the escape pods to avoid the 
			nuclear explosion which will follow.
