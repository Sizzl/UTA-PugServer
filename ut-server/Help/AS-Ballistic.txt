Description             : The Tournament has just recently gained the rights to
			  replay the terrorist operation that triggered World War 3.
			  If you are not aware of how these historical events took place
			  then let me summarize the known parts of it.

			  It all started on February 12th 2036. The worlds governments
			  had long tried to sign a permanent peace treaty, though the plan
			  had been halted because no land was seen as truly neutral. As a 
			  solution a member of each nation was sent onto a space station  
			  built especially  for this treaty.

			  Now all this may seem innocent enough, and no reason for a World
			  War that almost destroyed Earth, but as it seems not all were 
			  interested in a final peace. 

			  A group of terrorists infiltrated a well guarded military base, to
			  launch a missile at the space station and destroy it.  Whether these
			  persons were Mercenaries for arms dealers, terrorists, a highly 
			  secret military group working for an unknown government or someone 
			  else has never been discovered. A lot of conspiracy theories have been 
			  proposed, but none have been proven nor disproved.

			  In this tournament the attacking group are playing the terrorist group, 
			  whose goal is to infiltrate the missile base, and  launch the nuclear missile 
			  to destroy the space station, while the defending team is to prevent this. 
			  The space station will be out of reach 10 minutes after start of the map.

				
Comments		:  You should be able to follow this map through without getting lost.  The
			   bots know the way anyway.  That said there's a fair bit to discover in
			   the map to improve your assault time.

			   There is another version of the map with a much better end sequence.
			   However this caused 4.13 clients to crash when on +4.20 servers.
			   The version is still available at http://  should you want it
