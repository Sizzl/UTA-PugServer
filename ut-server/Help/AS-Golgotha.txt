Notes                   : The way map looks is the way is see the world...........NOT!
                          Anyway I was tired of all military bases and stuff and
                          wanted to make something different.
                          There is some interactivity but you have to explore the map
                          yourself.

Notes AL version        : I mainly changed some item placement, and moved attackers
                          second spawn point abit closer to the objective.
                          Also the Temple teleporter is disabled after
                          Undead Temple gets breached when no longer needed,
                          The Cave Teleporter gets disabled after Hurons path to avoid 
                          spawncamping. And a small delay on the Dungeon doors.
