ver 1.1
All autocannons are gone, the missile turret is only firing off the missiles twice.
Only one mortar is left and firing rate is slower and shorter.
Insted I added some claymores, that can be fired once.
I fixed most of the Bsp bugs on the floors.
Its a small update, but I hope you enjoy it.

ver 1.2
Added three teleporters,an elevator on the bridge and added more ammo and sniperrifle 
at the start.
This version is made for multiplayer mode in mind.

-=[ Notes ]=-
I have noted a couple of bugs, but I´m pleased with the map (lots of action).
As a defender you should take advantage of the base internal defense( mines, Missile turret)
Bots play pretty solid, give it a try on a network game.
Take notice that team colors shows pretty bad on the first floor in the main base,
in a network game you can sneak in if you are lucky.
Bots see you as a enemy though!
