Description             : You mission:

			  - Destroy the 2 fuses to open the main fort gate or find
			    another way inside.

			  - Get over the lavapit and destroy the enemy lava energy
			    generator.

			 This is the second release of my first map. 

			  Too many things have changed to list them all but here
			  are the important ones:

			  - Added a door to the attackers spawnpoint. It will automaticly
			    explode after 10 secs giving the defense some more time
			    to get organized.

			  - Made the cave leading to the fort larger so that it'll not 
			    be possible to stop the attackers by shooting grenades, 
			    flakshells etc... around the corner..

			  - A bridge that leads over a lava pool was added

			  - No more easy hammerjumping inside the Fort. Well, it's
			    still possible just a lot harder to do.
			    There are 2 different ways to hammerjump inside (the
 			    easier one needs 2 hammerjumps, the other one only
			    1). Be sure however that the minigun-cannon is temporarily
		            disabled before you try or else it will be nearly impossible
			    to get inside.

			  - The attacker's spawnpoint will change to a closer position
			    after about 5 mins. This should make the game more interesting
			    at the end and give weak attackers more chance to win.

			  - The minnigun-cannon is now on the other side and more of a
			    threat now. However it's still possible to sneak around it...
			    (And don't forget that you can disable it for a while
			    by shooting at it)

			  - You'll have to destroy the 2 energy-fuses (to open Lock 1 & 2)
			    instead of the gate-controller to open the fort gates. The main
			    gate takes about 10 seconds to open; again to leave the
			    defenders a bit more time to get organized.

			  - There are a few new building inside the fort now with some
			    interesting sniper places for the defenders _and_ attackers...

			  - There are now 3 possible ways over the lavapit. 
			    1) Using the lift
			    2) You'll have a chance of escaping the lavapit...
			    3) I bet you'll find that one too (Hint: No hammerjumps 
			       needed, it has something to do with the lift...)
			    The only way where the player takes no damage is nr 1.

			  - As mentioned before, there now is a possibility to escape 
			    the lavapit. If you fall into the pit you can still try
			    (if you got enough health/armor) to swim to the side and 
			    enter the small cave. From there you can go up through
			    the fan room to the main base.

			  - The other side of the lift now has some sort of base. 				    
		            The defenders spawn there and can take teleporters to
			    different places on the map or just get out of the base
			    to defend the final objective. There are now only 3 teleporters
			    instead of 4.

			  - Much better bot support...

			  - LOTS of visual changes...

			  - Item/weapon placement changes...

			  - Map screenshots...
