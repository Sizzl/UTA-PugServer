Changes in this ver.    : - Added more playerstarts
			  - Aligned some more textures
			  - Added a light over each lift at the main gates
			  - Fixed Advanced Guard Tower. It will now shoot rockets;
			    also added a small display that shows when AGT is active;
			    and added sounds to AGT when it opens
			  - Decorated a bit
			  - Main Gates will open after second spawnpoint has
			    been activated
			  - Fixed a bug that when opening the final Spawnpoint without
			    opening the second one first would cause attackers to spawn
			    on all three spawnpoints. 
			    If you open the final Spawnpoint you'll automaticly open
			    the second one if it's not already open.
			  - Lights over defenders teleporters will be turned off depending
			    on how far the assaulting team is.	(suggested by Speden)	

			    (If anyone has some info on the assaultrandomizers
			     please contact me; I can't get them working)	

     			Thanks to all the people for bug reports.


Description             : This is my second map.
				
			  This map is rather large; your goals are:

			  - to enter the enemy base
			  - fight your way through the lower and upper base to
			    reach the bridge
			  - Set 4 explosive charges on the bridge and detonate it

			  You have a total of 16 minutes time to finish the mission.
			  2 more assault spawnpoints can be discovered (not necessary
			  to finish but recommended).

				
Comments		: Thanks to all the people that responded to my question about
			  the screenshot and to all those that sent me comments. :)

			  Your comments about this new map are welcome. If you want
			  the latest info on my upcoming maps then visit my new homepage
			  at: http://members.xoom.com/ggcap

			  I created the map on a P2 333 with 192MB RAM Voodoo3 2000 and it 
			  runs fine. If I play it with 16 bots however it will slow down 
			  in the large outdoor areas when many bots are on the screen.

			
================================================================

Play Information	

Single Player Assault   : Yes (Bots act pretty good. Set them at least 
			  to Adept and they will even hammerjump sometimes) :)
			  Anyways, if you're a good UT player, even godlike bots
			  won't be a match for you.
Deathmatch              : No
Assault			: Yes
Recommended No. Bots    : 7-15
Comments		: There are a lot of places where you can take several ways
			  or even hammerjump. With the 2 more Assault spawnpoints
			  there sould be non-stop action as soon as the base has been
			  entered. 
			
			  When defending be sure to check out the 'advanced guard tower'.
			  It's located in the defenders	starting base on the 2nd floor.
			  When you're in front of the panel it will activate the missile
			  cannon. You can even snipe incoming attackers while standing
 			  there. Hope you like this new feature.
			  	
			  Big thanks to Arl & Don for playtesting this map for me 
			  and giving me valuable comments. :)

			  Big thanks to Don for submiting this map to the 'Make Something
			  Unreal Contest' on my behalf.

			  I'll probably release an AS-Bridge][ version with bigger changes
			  someday... ...but don't ask me when that day will be ;).
