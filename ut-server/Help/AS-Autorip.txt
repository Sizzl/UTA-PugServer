Play Information	

Single Player Assault   : Yes
Online Assault		: Yes
Recommended No. Bots    : 6-12.  More the better  

Comments		: This is a linear type map, but only one of the
			  objectives needs to be completed.  There are also
			  a few things to discover along the way.
			  There's a fair bit of interaction in this map
			  and i've tried very hard to get the bots to 
			  use it all.  However they sometimes get it a
			  bit wrong :)  Expect a different game everytime you
			  play it for the first few goes.
