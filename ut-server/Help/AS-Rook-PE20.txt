AS-Rook-PE20 [ PUG EDITION 2020 ]
Pickup Game edition of the oldskool Paint the Door map.
In order to make the map more fair and competitive i've changed a few things.

The original Assault objectives of AS-Rook are still in place. No major tweaks on main part of the map.
The ending of the map has been redone to make it a fair, but somewhat though, fight untill the end.
Endgame Canyon now has an alternative route to get to. Attackers have new spawnpoint halfway trough the game.
Defenders have teleporters to different parts of the map, and some will be disabled halfway trough.

Final trigger is placed behind an big door what opens on 'area control'. Attackers have to be in an particular area (big staircase) for about 10 seconds for the door to open enough. So they can reach the final point.

This version is the final version. IF any major issues occure during online games this might be tweaked later on.

PUG ON LADS!

NOTE
Hammerboost via gatehouse over the main doors is still possible. But players will need to drop between the two doors and take the alternative route. Obviously there is a specialevent trigger when such thing occures to inform defending team.
and there might be some launches possible from cave towards endgame door ;).


-----------------------
Changelog 25th October 2020 (FINAL VERSION)
- Replaced Pulserifle with biorifle in the courtyard.
- Tweaked the main door to make it less prone to 'painting the door'.
- Tweaked all vial spawntimers to 45 sec instead of default 30.

Changelog 22th October 2020

- Adjusted BlockPlayer Actors to have higher height radius.
- Redone the end-game arena. Canyon is now larger and the endgame trigger is behind a door that has to be opened. 
- Door in endgame arena is 'TriggerPound'. Meaning the attacking team needs to have control of the stairs for ca. 10 seconds before the door are opened far enough to get to the endgame flag.
- Adjusted defenders spawn point back in map. Takes a little longer (2 sec or so) to get into the final area to give attackers a better chance.
